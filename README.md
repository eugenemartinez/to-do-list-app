# To Do List

## Overview
The To Do List app is a simple and intuitive application that helps you manage your tasks efficiently. It allows you to add, edit, and remove tasks, set due dates, and mark tasks with different statuses. The app also includes a dark mode feature for a better user experience in low-light environments. All progress is saved in local storage, ensuring your tasks are preserved even after closing the browser.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks with a description and a due date.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify the details of existing tasks.
- **Remove Tasks**: Delete tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Task Statuses**: Mark tasks as "In Progress", "Stuck", or "Done".
- **Select All**: Quickly select or deselect all tasks.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark modes for better visibility.
- **Local Storage**: Automatically saves your tasks and their statuses in local storage.
